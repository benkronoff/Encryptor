#### header H4 Encryptor
Python script I was messing around with, wasn't a serious project but nevertheless it works and could easily be incorperated into an actual command etc. I don't normally code in Python so this is pretty simple, but I had a lot of fun learning by making this. Update: Added decode, with commented walkthrough. The encryptor will return a message and key, and you will need to use these in the correctly output format to decrypt. Send this repo to a friend and have fun!
