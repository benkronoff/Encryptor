##### Encrypt / Decrypt

This is just a Python script I was messing around with, wasn't a serious project but nevertheless it works well and could easily be incorperated into an actual command etc. 
I don't normally code in Python so this is pretty simple, but I had a lot of fun learning by making this. 

## Update: 
Added decode, with commented walkthrough. The encryptor will return a message and key, and you will need to use these in the correctly output format to decrypt. Send this repo to a friend and have fun!
